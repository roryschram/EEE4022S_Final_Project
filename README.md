## LoRa Based Communication System for Radiosonde Applications
### By Rory Schram

Welcome to my final year project GitHub page. This project focussed on the design and implementation of a LoRa-based radiosonde module for a weather balloon. Project files can be found in their respective folders, including all software, schematics, and PCB designs, for the transmission and receiver modules.
